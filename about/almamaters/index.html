	<p>BITS Pilani is regarded as one of the finest privately funded engineering institution in India. It has been consistently featuring among top 5 Indian institutions along with the IITs. I completed my Bachelors' in Electrical and Electronics (B.E.(hons.) EEE) from this university. Normally the duration to complete the degree is prescribed to be four years but I expedited the timeline by taking extra courses in both semesters of my Junior year thereby obtaining graduation in 3.5 years instead of 4. </p>
	<p>My Freshman year was spent doing basical level courses which developed an aptitude in general towards engineering. During my sophomore year I was introduced to courses Digital Design and Microprocessors that dealt with the digital side of Electronics and also Elctronic Devices and Micro-Electronics that deal with the analog side. Performing well in all of these courses made me realize that I had an equal interest in both Digital and Analog Electronics, something which is reflected through my <a href="/projects">projects</a> which lie in both of these domains. Apart form this, I also did courses on basics of signal processing and control systems which I thought were particularly interesting.</p>
	<p>Junior year exposed me to VLSI design and communication systems, both of which are my primary areas of interest. Analog Electronics was another crucial mandatory course that was like the icing on the cake since it helped me gather knowledge about implementing my simulations into hardware by imparting me know-hows abuout crucial electronic components essential in building the hardware and actually realizing my designs. Most of my bachelor level publications (<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7743726/?reload=true">Adiabatic SRAM</a>, <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7848424/">Ultrasonic Sensing System</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/gview?embedded=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fd1keuthy5s86c8.cloudfront.net%2Fstatic%2Fems%2Fupload%2Ffiles%2Fithws_t07p14_75171.pdf">Optical Sensing System</a>) are due the knowledge that I gathered during these courses. This was also the year for exploring my myraid interests since this was when I was eligible to take electives. The course on Satellite communications was particularly helpful in fixating my interest on wireless communications and it helped me decide that wanted I wanted to do a PhD in this area. I also decided to secure basic information coding concepts (atleast the physical layer thoroughly) since we all know that communications and networking go hand in hand. So I took a course on Data Communications and Networking. When one does learn about communications, signal processing is a useful skill to have. That led me to take Digital Signal Processing, which also included doing a project on any application related to signal processing. I chose image processing and did a project on basic eye-ball tracking. I continued the work duing the next year and that too resulted in a publication (<a href="/publications">Refer to publications</a>).</p>
	<p>The senior year for me consisted of only one one semester since I graduated early.I spent that time doing my bachelor's thesis. It was related to designing RFID tags for transmitting temperatures of post-surgical patients wrelessly. More details about the same is available in <a href="/projects">projects</a>, under the section RFID Tags.</p>

<!-- Second Institution -->
	<p>2.Pace Junior Science College </p>
	<p>Attended from: June 2011 - June 2013. </p>
	<p><a href="http://www.iitianspace.com/">PACE Coaching classes</a></p>
	<p> I attended IITian's PACE Coaching classes during my preparation for IIT-JEE which is one of the toughest and most competitive enginnering entrance exams globally. The fact that the institution had its own high school (PACE Junior Science College) helped me immensely since I was able to distribute my time between coaching and school with ease. During these two years I learned the most important concepts in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics which later helped me during my engineering.

<!-- Third Institution -->
	<p>3.Swami Vivekand International School</p>
	<p>Attended from: June 2000 - May 2011. </p>
	<p><a href="http://svischool.com/Gorai/" title="Swami Vivekand International School">BITS Pilani K.K Birla Goa Campus</a></p>

	<p> This institutuion consisted of my junior, middle and part of high school. I was awarded the 'Best Boy' of the passing out batch award by the director of the school.</p>
